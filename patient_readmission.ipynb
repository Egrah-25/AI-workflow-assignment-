## Problem Scope
**Problem:** A hospital needs an AI system that predicts whether a patient is at risk of being readmitted within 30 days of discharge.  
**Objective:** Reduce readmission rates, improve care quality, and optimize resource allocation.  
**Stakeholders:** Hospital administration, healthcare providers, patients, IT and data teams.

# Ethical concerns
Markdown("""
### Ethical Concerns
1. **Patient Privacy:** Ensure anonymization and compliance with data protection regulations (HIPAA).  
2. **Data Bias:** Unequal representation of demographics could lead to unfair risk scores.

# --- üöÄ Deployment Plan ---
Markdown("""
### Deployment Plan
1. **Integration:** Connect model to hospital's Electronic Health Records (EHR) for real-time prediction at discharge.  
2. **Monitoring:** Continuously track prediction accuracy and false alarms.  
3. **Compliance:**  
   - Follow HIPAA for secure data storage and transmission.  
   - Restrict model access to authorized hospital staff.

# --- üß† Optimization (Overfitting Solution) ---
Markdown("""
### Optimization
To address **overfitting**, apply **cross-validation** or reduce model complexity by limiting tree depth in RandomForest.
""")

# --- üí¨ Ethics & Bias ---
Markdown("""
## Ethics & Bias
Biased data (e.g., underrepresentation of older patients) can cause inaccurate risk predictions and unfair treatment.  
**Mitigation Strategy:** Perform bias detection audits and re-balance datasets using sampling or weighting.
""")

# --- ‚öñÔ∏è Trade-offs ---
Markdown("""
## Trade-offs
- **Interpretability vs Accuracy:** Simpler models (like Logistic Regression) are easier to explain but may be less accurate than complex ones (like RandomForest).  
- **Limited Resources:** If computing power is low, prefer lightweight models such as Logistic Regression or Decision Tree over deep learning models.
""")

# --- ‚ú® Reflection ---
Markdown("""
## Reflection
**Most challenging part:** Designing the preprocessing pipeline and balancing model performance with interpretability.  
**Improvement with more resources:** Access to real EHR data and better compute power for hyperparameter tuning.
