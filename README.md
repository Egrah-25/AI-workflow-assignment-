# 🏥 Patient Readmission Risk Prediction

This project applies the **AI Development Workflow** to a real-world healthcare scenario.  
It demonstrates how to build, train, and evaluate a machine learning model that predicts whether a patient is likely to be **readmitted within 30 days** of hospital discharge.

---

## 📘 Problem Scope
- **Goal:** Predict 30-day patient readmission to improve care and resource allocation.  
- **Stakeholders:** Hospital administrators, clinicians, patients, and data teams.  

---

## 📊 Data Strategy
- Synthetic dataset generated to simulate patient records (age, hospital stay, medications, etc.).  
- Ethical concerns considered:
  1. Patient privacy (HIPAA compliance).  
  2. Data bias and fairness in prediction outcomes.  

---

## ⚙️ Preprocessing
- Feature scaling using `StandardScaler`.  
- Train-test split (80/20).  
- Feature engineering based on medical variables.  

---

## 🤖 Model Development
- **Algorithm:** Random Forest Classifier (chosen for robustness and interpretability).  
- **Metrics Evaluated:** Precision, Recall, and Accuracy.  
- **Visualization:** Confusion matrix for classification performance.

**Key Outputs:**
- `predictions_results.csv` — Model predictions vs actual outcomes.  
- `model_metrics.csv` — Precision, Recall, and Accuracy scores.  

---

## 🚀 Deployment Plan
- Integrate with hospital EHR systems for real-time readmission risk predictions.  
- Ensure compliance with healthcare data laws (e.g., HIPAA).  
- Secure model access for authorized staff only.  

---

## 🧠 Optimization
- Used cross-validation and tree depth control to prevent overfitting.

---

## ⚖️ Ethics & Bias
- Addressed bias through balanced datasets and fairness audits.  
- Continuous monitoring to ensure equitable outcomes for all patient demographics.  

---

## 🧩 Reflection
- **Most challenging part:** Designing a realistic preprocessing pipeline and ensuring ethical compliance.  
- **Future improvements:** Use real EHR data and hyperparameter tuning with larger datasets.
